React 1st video :

parent component- APP
sending values to child comp  and and printing in parent component
code:
class App extends Compponent{
constructor(props){
super(props);
this.state.employee={"name":"saiChandu","dept":"HR"}
}
or
state={
employee:{"name":"saiChandu","dept":"HR"}
}
render(){
return( 
<div class="App"> 
Employee List :
<Employee employee={this.state.employee}/>
</div>
)
}
}
export default App
---------------------------------------------
child component:
getting values from parent class.

code:
const Employee = (props) =>{
return(
<div>
Employee Name : {props.employee.name}
Employee dept : {props.employee.dept}
</div>
)
}
export default Employee 
---------------------------------------------
class component contains render method.(App)
functional component does'nt have render method(Employye.js)
lifecycle will be there for class component not for functional component.
To pass values from parent to child we use props.
if we are creating functional compnent we need to export it.
